              I really do love to code, not only is it something that I can do
              professionaly but it's something that I'm truly passionate about.
              I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into solutions.

              I've been coding off and on for years, life has it's twists and
              turns which have thrown me through some loops, but I'm back and
              here to stay. I started in Ruby on Rails, some c++, and c#, but
              have since learned React, which is where my focus is now.

              Born and raised in Utah, so I guess I'm your typical Utahn when I
              say that I LOVE the outdoors, I love to ski, hike, bike, climb,
              fish, really anything outside, I love to do it!
